# Specification Quality Checklist: Drift Dataset Generation & Procurement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
- Tooling references (Darts, shared core module) appear only in the Assumptions/Dependencies
  sections as contextual notes inherited from the constitution and repo structure, not as
  requirements; functional requirements and success criteria remain technology-agnostic.
- Three scope-level decisions (eval corpus size ≈25/flavor + ≈10 combined; dual in-memory +
  on-disk delivery; Δt knob exposed with threshold deferred) were resolved with the user before
  drafting, so no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed.
